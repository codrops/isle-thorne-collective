/**
 * Peel: once the next page is ready, the page turns over like a sheet of
 * paper, a fold sweeping from the bottom-right corner to the top-left one. On
 * "back" the previous page turns back over this one. Nothing moves while the
 * next page loads: the loader
 * (`src/components/Loader.astro`), if the site has it, shows if that takes a
 * while.
 *
 * It's all flat: the old page is a still copy kept in the layer
 * (`keepOldPage()`), over the real new page. The copy, the flap (the back of
 * the sheet: the turned part mirrored across the fold) and the dark films that
 * shade the sheet and the page under it are `clip-path` polygons, recomputed
 * as the fold moves.
 *
 * Needs: `src/lib/interlude/old-page.ts`.
 * Inspired by the page turn on eminente.art.
